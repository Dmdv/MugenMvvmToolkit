    <description>
      This package contains the 'Getting Started' assemblies for Xamarin.Forms platform.
      Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes it easier to develop cross-platform application using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a cross-platform MVVM development framework built on top of:
      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP7.1, WP8, WP8.1
      - Xamarin.Android
      - Xamarin.iOS
      - Xamarin.Forms
      - WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps
      The MVVM framework includes the following features that differs this project from other frameworks:
      - Deep integration with each platform.
      - Supports state preservation and restoration for mobile platforms.
      - Full Fragment support for Android, you do not need to worry about activity, fragments, sub-fragments or their state all this makes the framework.
      - Solves the nested user controls problem in MVVM, all view models are dynamically created by you, using the GetViewModel method and you do not need to use the ViewModelLocator.
      - Supports all kinds of navigation like modal window, page navigation, tab navigation, back stack fragment navigation for android. You can also easily add a new kind of navigation.
      - Navigation system works with view models and allows to expect the completion of the operation. You can pass any parameters between view models.
      - Good design mode support, for xaml platforms supports the creation of design view model with any constructor parameters.
      - Supports bindings on all platforms, all of the native binding features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more.
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc.
      - Supports subscription to any control event.
      - Built-in support for validation.
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings.
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings.
      - Binding parser builds syntax tree that allows you to easily change or extend the bindings, without manipulation of the raw text.
      - Binding supports fluent syntax.
      - Excellent binding performance.
